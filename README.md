**🔐 Login Authentication System**

This project demonstrates a basic client-side login authentication system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple interface where users can enter their username and password, and the system validates these credentials against predefined values (e.g., admin and 1234). The authentication here happens entirely in the browser, meaning no data is sent to a server or database. This approach is suitable for learning purposes, prototypes, or small offline applications, but not for production use, as credentials are easily visible in the page’s source code.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

HTML5 – For structuring the web page.

CSS3 – For simple styling and layout.

JavaScript (ES6) – For handling login validation logic and DOM manipulation.

**🚀 Features**

Minimal and clean UI for login.

Client-side credential validation (no backend required).

Real-time feedback for successful or failed login attempts.

Responsive and lightweight design.

**⚡ Challenges Faced**

Ensuring proper DOM element references inside the script.

Avoiding variable name conflicts (e.g., let u = document.getElementById('u')).

Handling user feedback dynamically without reloading the page.

Maintaining readability and simplicity in inline JavaScript.
